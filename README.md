Do you mean a data‑structures project you worked on for the past 3 months? What do you want me to do with it? Pick one (or more) of these and I’ll proceed:

- Review the code and give feedback (bugs, style, complexity).
- Summarize the project into a README / portfolio entry.
- Explain the data structures and algorithms you used (with time/space complexity).
- Optimize or refactor specific files/functions.
- Write tests or add example usage.
- Create slides / a short presentation or a clean project summary.
